My name is Sasuke Uchiha.
And I hate a lot of things. I particularly don't like anything.
And I want to destroy a certain someone.

These Sharingans can see through everything.
I can see through all your lies. Again and again and again!

Why do you keep following me? What am I to you?
For certainly I have turned into a MONSTER!

Don't even say Itachi's name. You cold blooded murderer.

Itachi devoted his life for the hidden leaf village. He thought like a Hokage when he was just 8 years old.
The leaders of the Leaf Village used him, used his powers to go against his own clan.

Take Action
Start new

Life is meaningful when you realize nothing is under your control.

what is life? What is the meanign of living? Why are we even here?
These questions are my friend, a mystery.

Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery and Today is a gift.
That's why its called Present.

The system is so very cruel.

KUNG FU PANDA ! Master oggy!
